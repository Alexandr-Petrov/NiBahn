 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * \subsection info_sec Project Information
 * As part of the T_17 group that enrolled in the course Embedded Systems and Robotics 1 at TH-Wildau,
 * we've got small robots controlled by a main controller and co-controller, lots of sensors, can move around.
 * and also show the data on the display. As a task we have received mandatory tasks and tasks that we were able to choose ourselves.
 * in the tasks that we have chosen we have implemented mandatory functions:
 * 1. Communication between the Nibo and PC using xBee
 * 2. Communication between Nibos using xBee
 * 3. Following the black line(extra function)
 * 4. Visualization of the role of the Nibo in the chain using the display and LEDs
 *
 * \subsection software_sec Used Software
 * 1. VMWare Image already provided by the Docent with a deployed projects HelloXBee and HelloxBee_PC in EclipseCDT that were used as the template for the own projects
 * 2. DIGI XCTU configuration and test utility for xBee module
 *
